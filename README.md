# ✅ Smart Irrigation System (Agriventure)


---

## 🌱 **Overview**

Our solution is a **Smart Irrigation System** with a **user-friendly web interface**, enabling **remote operation**.
The system uses a **Weather API** to monitor real-time conditions like **rainfall** and **temperature**, ensuring that the pump operates **only when necessary**.
By integrating **crop type** and **crop size** data, it calculates the **precise water requirements** for optimal irrigation.

✅ This ensures:

* **Efficient water usage**
* **Reduced wastage**
* **Sustainable farming**
* **Improved crop productivity**

---

## ✨ **Key Features**

1. **AI-Based Plant Disease Prediction**
   Predicts potential plant diseases, enabling **early preventive actions**.

2. **E-commerce Integration**
   Farmers can **purchase seeds, fertilizers, pesticides** through the platform.

3. **Weather Updates**
   Real-time weather **forecast & conditions** for smart irrigation planning.

4. **Automated Soil Moisture Analysis**
   Advises **ON/OFF** pump actions based on **soil moisture level**.

5. **Crop Type Analysis**
   Calculates **exact water needs** using **crop type** & **humidity forecast**.

6. **Security Features**

   * Animal deterrence
   * Unauthorized access alarms
   * CCTV monitoring

7. **Crop Suggestion Based on Soil Analysis**
   Recommends **best crops** based on soil health.
